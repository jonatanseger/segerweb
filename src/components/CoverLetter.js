        <p>Hi,
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          My name is Jonatan Seger and I’m 25 years old. I’m born and raised in
          Stockholm, Enskede to be explicit. When I started school in
          Tallkrogens Skola I used to do a lot of sports and building treehouses
          on my spare time. I went on to high school in Enskede Skola where I
          put even more time into sports. But when upper secondary school came,
          I only played hockey and I have kept on playing until this very day. I
          studied the scientific program at Kärrtorps Gymnasium as well as
          having a part time job at Länna Sport. When finished there I went on
          to study 5 years at KTH and I have played hockey on national level.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          During my time at the Media Technology track at KTH I soon got the
          chance to learn how to create websites and what is of importance when
          building an interface. I have familiarized with MVC and its
          programming languages as well as React.js. The time has come for me to
          get out into the industry and continue to develop my skills. I’ve
          built this website with React to demonstrate my current knowledge. Apart
          from websites I have also become familiar with Java, Python, SQL, XML,
          HCI, Business, and a lot more. I aim at acquiring a junior position
          within front-end development to keep improving my skills and knowledge
          in React, CSS, HTML, och JavaScript/JSX.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Last Spring, I wrote my master’s thesis at Tele2’s UX department about
          product development with a usability perspective. How to quality
          control one’s digital products was of major importance. During this
          opportunity I got to see agile development and how they function as
          well as some insight into CRM, BI, etc.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Apart from technical skills, my education has provided me with
          thinking patterns and how innovation is created and driven. An eye for
          detail and a critical perspective have made me thorough and to
          question pretty much everything I touch, which according to me has
          improved my perception of what is good/bad during development. I have,
          through all my experiences, fostered a sense of whom should do what
          part of the project, which eases teamwork. Often during group
          assignments, I have taken the leading role in the group, this may be
          because my structured and analytical way of working and communicating
          with my peers.
          <br></br>

          Thank you for your attention!
