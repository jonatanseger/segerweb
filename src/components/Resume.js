        <h3>MASTER THESIS AT TELE2 AB, STOCKHOLM</h3>
        <h4>How In-House Usability Testing Increases Product Development, 2019</h4>
        <p>My assignment was to study the current usability testing process at
        Tele2 and to compare it with the first ever in-house test. The purpose
        was to improve the testing process and to make it more agile and of
        higher quality to a lower expense. A survey combined with interviews
        and observations paved the way for the results and discussion. The main
        finding was that the company in question can do a lot more usability
        testing if its in-house which will further enhance the feedback on how
        the website of Tele2 can improved.

        revolving design, HCD, insight driven development, product evaluation,
        how to work with hypothesis and much more.</p>

        <h2>SKILLS</h2>
        <p><strong>Leadership </strong>– I’m currently assistant captain in my team and I have
        been captain or assistant captain during my 17 years as a hockey player.
        The various group assignments in school have given me experience with
        all different kinds of people from all over the world.</p>
        <br></br>

        <p><strong>Cooperative </strong>– I’m happy to help my peers as well as
        to work side-by-side with others. A group/team is not stronger than its
        weakest link. That is why everyone must help each other for everyone to
        become the best version of themselves.</p>
        <br></br>
        <p><strong>Engaged </strong>– every new situation I encounter motivates
        me to learn and develop. My worst fear is being the weakest link in the
        team, that is why I strive at improving all the time. Once I feel
        comfortable, I try to help others to make them improve. In the perfect
        world no one would be the weakest link.</p>
